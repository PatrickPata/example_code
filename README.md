## Example Global Code

The file test_script.Rmd is a markdown file showing how to create the global LPI based upon the publically available data. It contains some helper functions that convert a table of population rates of change (one population per row) into a global index using the LPI methodology.
	
## Example Canadian Code

The file test_script_canadian.Rmd is a markdown file showing how to create the Canadian Species Index (using the LPI method) based upon the candadian data in data/CIEE_LPI_dataset.csv. It modifies the code from the above global example to account for some slight differences in how the CSI is made (e.g. no weightings and no realm data).
